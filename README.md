# data-analyst-portfolio - Rohan Sakariya 
This repository contains my **Data Analysis & Automation Projects** built during my Diploma in Computer Engineering (Parul University, CGPA 7.26/10).
I created these projects to improve my **Excel, Python, and Data Verification Skills with a focus on solving real-world business problems.**

**Projects**
1. **Sample Project 1- Academic Grading System (Excel)**
     - Build a **grading calculator** using Excel formulas (IF, SUM, RANK).
     - Automated grade assignment (A+ to F) based on percentage.
   
      **Mistake I made**:
        - At first, I created a wrong chart and did not prepare proper table info.
        - Later, I corrected it - learned how to properly design charts.
    - Learning Outcome: Stronger skills in Excel formulas & data visualization.
  
2. **Sample Project 2- Sales & Finance Dashboard (Excel)**
     - Designed a financial report using **PivotTables** and **Conditional Formatting**.
     - Created insights for department-wise performance.
       
      **Mistake I made**:
        - Initially, pivot table setup was wrong, and formatting looked messy.
        - Corrected errors - learned conditional formatting & clean reporting.

3. **Automated Payroll & Data Verification System (Python + Excel)**
     - Developed a **Python Automation Script** that calculated salaries, validates data, and generates excel reports.
   
       **Features**:
           - Data validation (attendance errors auto-fixed).
           - Per-day salary, net salary, department summaries.
           - Excel reports auto-generated with ₹ Indian currency formatting.
   
       **Challenges I faced**:
           - Many errors during execution - fixed step by step.
           - In Excel, bonus column first showed **#####** - solved by adjusting column width.
           - Applied ₹ currency formatting only on salary columns, not on attendance days.
       
        **Learning Outcome**: Hands-on experience in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Openpyxl) and end-to-end automation.
   
  **Skills Used**:
     - **Excel**: Formulas (SUM, IF, VLOOKUP, RANK), PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Charts.
     - **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Openpyxl, Excel Writer.
     - **Data Skills**: Data Cleaning, Verification, Automation, Report Generation.

  **About Me**:

      - Passionate about data analysis & automation.
      - Strong at problem solving & attention to detail.
      - Looking to start my career as a Data Verification Assistant / Data Analyst.
